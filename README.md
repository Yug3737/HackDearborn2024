# Snap&Serve
An application that allows you to take a photo of a QR code and see what the nutrition info is.

## Introduction
In India and other countries have proposed implementing a symbol-based front of packaging nutrition info system. This system is based off of WHO recommendations for the daily recommendations for calories, sugar, fat, and other nutrients. If they exceeded the recommended limit then there would be a red icon on the front of the package. This is helpful for those who want to be more aware of what they consume and allows the consumer to be informed of what they are about to buy may not be the best for them. This could be beneficial for overall health on consumers and allow them to be more aware of what they eat and drink. 

## How we built it:
Front-end: React
Back-end: Flask
APIs used: Gemini 1.5 pro and Open food facts API

## Challenges
We at first were using react-native. This was going well until we realized that it would be difficult to support our needs for the camera. We switched to react halfway through hacking and we had to completely restructure our project. 

## Accomplishments
The backend has had very little issues. We were able to easily adapt and overcome our challenges and we created a good product that we are proud of. 

## What we learned
We learned how react and react native work and their limitations. We need to research the APIs and what we never worked with before beginning to hack.
